# Exploring-Titanic-Dataset
In This project, I will explore the titanic data, find relationships among its variables.

# Titanic Dataset Overview:
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS
Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats
for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of
people were more likely to survive than others.

# Main findings
## Q1: Was young people more likely to survive?
People from first class were more likely to survive than people from second class,
and people from second class were more likely to survive than people from the third
class
## Q2: Was survival rate bigger with females than males?
• Survival rate was bigger with females than males
• men with first class tickets were more likely to survive than other men
• women with third class tickets had a small survival rate
## Q3: Was young people more likely to survive?
Children were more likely to survive than other age groups
## Q4: did the number of siblings affect the survival rate?
Yes, number of siblings affect the survival rate
## Q5: Did number of parents / children affect the survival rate
Yes, number of parents / children affect the survival rate.
## Q6: Did the port of embarkation affect the survival rate?
People who embarked from Cherbourg were more likely to survive, but this
doesn't mean that this was a reason (correlation doesn't imply causation)
